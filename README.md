# Zoom-Bike-Share-Performance-Dashboard

*I had the opportunity to build an interactive and insightful dashboard designed to help stakeholders at Zoom Bike Share make data-driven decisions. The dashboard brings together key performance indicators and visualizations to tell the full story behind revenue, rider trends, and profitability.*

# Highlights & Key Insights:

- Hourly Revenue : Identified peak revenue hours between 11 AM to 5 PM — ideal for targeting pricing or promotions
  
- Revenue & Profit Trends : Clear seasonal increases observed in spring and summer months — suggesting opportunities for dynamic pricing

- Rider Demographics : Over 80% of riders are registered users — a strong signal of loyalty and potential for retention-focused campaigns

  # Insightful Annotations:

- Revenue peaks in summer ($4.9M), suggesting high demand — price adjustments can be piloted during this season

- Registered riders account for over 80% of usage, indicating loyalty — consider membership perks to increase retention

- With a consistent increase in riders and high revenue during summer and weekends, a moderate price increase of 5–10% during peak months could be tested to maximize  profitability
  
- If the price in 2022 was 4,99 $, Increase would make the new about 5,49 $

  # Recommendations :
  
- Implement dynamic pricing during summer and peak weekend hours

- Offer loyalty perks for registered riders to increase long-term retention

- Monitor seasonal drops to plan marketing pushes in winter
